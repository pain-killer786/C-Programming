The issue might be due to the space in the directory path (`My Digital Garage`). Git might not correctly interpret the `.gitignore` rule because of this. To fix it, you can try escaping the space in the path or enclosing the folder name in quotes when working with Git commands.

Additionally, ensure that the `.vscode/` folder is not already tracked by Git. If it is, you need to untrack it first. Here's how:

1. Remove the `.vscode/` folder from Git's tracking:
    ```bash
    git rm -r --cached .vscode/
    ```

2. Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Stop tracking .vscode folder"
    ```

3. Verify that the `.gitignore` rule is working by creating a new file in `.vscode/` and checking its status:
    ```bash
    git status
    ```

If `.vscode/` is ignored, it won't appear in the output of `git status`.
